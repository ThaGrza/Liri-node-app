# LIRI-BOT

Liri Bot is a command line driven assistant to help find song information, arist/band concert information and movie information.
The app works by typing in a keyword like 'spotify-this-song' along with a song you'd like information about, i.e " spotify-this-song Old Town Road" and Liri will console log the arists, song name, album name, and a link to the song.
To get Liri up and running you can use 'node liri.js' with 1 of 4 commands: spotify-this-song, concert-this, movie-this, and do-what-it-says.
Each keyword will will perform a different action according to what is given.
The Liri bot uses:
Node-Spotify-APi,
Axios,
Moment,
DotEnv,
Bands-in-town api, and the Omdb-api.

I, Andrew Griswold, was the sole developer on the app and created all functionality from scratch.
